As my doctor sent me to a specialist to understand the cause of my gum recession, I was told (by the specialist) that the main problem is the bone loss.  In my case, the gum just follows the bone.  Essentially he wants to do a deep cleaning as a way of slowing the bone loss. I am having a problem accepting that plaques and caveties are the reason for my oral bone loss. I am not sure I feel convinced as I have been flossing since I ever remember.  I never bleed when cleaning my teeth.

I've suffered from tinnitus for 10+ years now and the noises themselves have never been too much of a nuisance, but in recent months I've started to experience significant pain, soreness, itching, tingling, and throbbing in my ears, along with headaches, jaw pain and vertigo.

this is whats listed for vitex? 
Vitex does not contain natural hormones. It appears to increase progesterone by stimulating luteinizing hormone release from the pituitary gland. Vitex also normalizes excessive prolactin, promoting fertility. 
Female infertility

PMS, especially breast tenderness, cramping, and headaches

Acne, especially if it is related to the menstrual cycle

Fibrocystic breast disease

Heavy menstruation

Once a therapist suggested I�d been depressed since childhood, but I quickly dismissed her. But recently I�ve been thinking she was right.

Should he see a psychiatrist, psychologist or a counsellor? In my understanding, a psychiatrist can diagnose, use therapy and prescribe medication, whilst a psychologist can't prescribe medication.
The literature I've read about BPD indicates that medication is not always beneficial, that various forms of long term therapy in which the BP's relearn coping mechanisms and appropriate emotional responses is more appropriate.
Therefore, would a psychologist be sufficient? Money is an issue as he has recently lost his job again and I understand a psychiatrist is very expensive.
I have read other peoples questions and answers related to this. There seems to be a popular idea that we all have problems at times and that these people are often misdiagnosed. I am studying psychology(I've only just started) and I know this is real.

No need to tell you the specifics I think you can figure it out! I was tormented every day. In school and at home. I got made fun of everyday at school because of my clothes. My mom was poor and on welfare. I remember having 4 pairs of jeans and 4 tee shirts. Not so long ago my mother died from a drug overdose as well as natural causes in which the drugs contributed. I was devestated. Could all these lead to they way I feel now? Everytime I see a wisper and someone looking at me I automatically assume they are talking about me and engage in serious confrontation! I am smart! But I can't seem to get my emotions under control! I was kicked out of the military with a broken hand from a boxer's fracture. They said I was unfit for military duty.

The lump is slightly larger than 1 inch long, in an oval shape about 3/4-1inch thick.  I would guess the volume of about 1cubic inch total. It's hard, not squishy, and doesn't move more than a hair in any direction. It seems to be fine until I touch it. It's not like 'ouch!' painful, just tender. The skin around it is smooth and red, stretched a bit.  It's located dead-center between my belly button and gential area. Doesn't seem to be a lymphnode but I am not that familiar with lymphnodes.  When I gently pressed around it I noticed also that above my genital region the whole area (size of palm) is puffy.

Then I had some cholesterol levels that got high after going on Atkins.  My doctor prescribed ""Zetia"" (a drug that is not a statin but has similar side effects) and I also developed some muscle problems that led to an injury and a few months of physical therapy.

Don't tell me that this side-effect is ""rare""!  It's probably present to some extent in a large fraction of the population.

I am curious as to it being unhealthy compared to anorexia.  I understand that anorexia is a mental disorder.  I also understand that weight loss surgery is not.  But is the limited food intake comparable to anorexia?  I understand that a large person cannot be anorectic, because being anorectic involves having distorted image of ones self.  Isn't rapid weight loss a sign of anorexia?  And isn't the rapid weight loss a result of not being able to eat, either physically or emotionally, wouldn't that be considered anorexia also?

I am not trying to be disrespectful, I am just trying to understand this.  I have struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and I have  friends who  had weight loss surgery.  I see them acting the same ways as I have in the past.  I want to notice if something is wrong."

So, after my dentist did the root canal, he put some medicine in the other tooth and sealed it up.  He said he wanted to watch that tooth to see if that one would have to have a root canal also.  My question is...how can you tell if it needs to have a root canal or not? It doesn't seem swollen or sensitive or anything like that...like I have been brushing it for awhile now and it doesn't hurt or anything like that.  How long after he put the medicine in can you tell if it should have a root canal or not?  What are the symptoms? 
 
Lastly and this is kind of embarrassing but...ever since I have begun dental work ( after 10 years or so of not going to the dentist ), I have noticed that I have begun to drool more than usual.  Now, I used to drool...does that have anything to do with it?  Does the recent dental work have anything to do with it? 
 
Thanks in advance!!"

Hello to everyone out there who are going through issues that only therapists and psychiatrists can begin to grasp.  It is such a lonely feeling to be diagnosed with a mental health disorder.  In my case, I have multiple problems. In addition to my subject list, I also dread the lack of daylight that we are now facing.  I have all of these problems floating around in my head and have no idea how I function at work much less at home. I feel that I am basically a failure and a freak most of the time and the fact that I have to be on several different medications just seals the deal.  The underlying question I keep asking is why can't I be normal like everyone else.  Surely I could be  better wife and mother if not for all of these disorders.  I don't dare disclose my problems at work.  I somehow just fake my way through the day and no one has to know.  My daughter is very independent which is a good thing but I feel detached from her.

From my own observations, it seems that I tend to be more focused and pay attention better after eating or doing certain things.
When I don't have a good night sleep I have difficulty hearing what people are saying, it's like my mind blocks them out intentionally for some reason.
If I don't eat right, I become self-absorbed and become less alert to the environment around me (bad for driving!).
If I don't drink an energy drink on a work day I am more prone to passive-aggression and holding grudges against others, and fail to be more openminded and see things from other peoples' point of view.

I've been really busy but I decided today to go see a doctor. Now, I could go right away or I could wait till tomorrow morning, which would be the most convenient. 

Would you guys recommend going now or waiting? I don't want to lose any hearing by being lazy.

I don't know ANYONE who lives on 1000 calories per day, and am finding this diet extremely difficult to adhere to, as there are tons more things you are NOT allowed to have than you are.  b)Does anyone have any advice about exercise options for someone with physical limitations?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as my weight is contributing to various other health problems, and I have my three children to consider."

My question is since I'm 40 I'm a little concerned with going with a OBYGN since I've heard that they tend to order C-sections more readily if the mother is over 40 (?). I've heard that a midwife might 
not so quickly (?) But Midwifes  don't use epid. as much as a OBGYN does (right?)

All the crying, gas,etc came right back within 2 days.  So, back we go to Enfamil Nutramigen!!!

A few hours later, my elbow still felt some pain. 
There's no bruises whatsoever.
When I touched it, I felt as if there is some thing in my elbow that's moving a bit. And it felt a bit pain.

Two months later (which is now), I could still feel this ""moving object"" in my elbow. And I felt some pain whenever it hit any hard surface (even lightly).  
And there's no bruises at all.
At normal times, it doesn't feel any pain.

So what's wrong?

I don't want to go to the doc as it'll be an embarrassment if there's nothing wrong with it."

I need to prepare myself, and my family for the most likely outcome :(  I know that each situation is different, which is why i'm not relying on statistics, but its seems that everything I read, it is likely the patient may last a few years after the treatment, but the best they can do is slow the cancer down, rather than rid the cancer cells, and leave him in remission.

I am desperately seeking the names of physicians who can treat a parasitic disease which has settled in my mouth, throat, larynx, sinus cavities and now moving into my ears and eyes. For 5 years now, the pain is getting progressively worse.  Currently, I have excruciating pain in my mouth, I am having increasing difficulty breathing and swallowing and this is getting critical since I am wheezing with each breath.  I have very serious underlying health problems that include multiple congenital heart problems and Hepatitis C contracted via a blood transfusion.

I cannot eat without being in almost unbearable pain.  This pain is NOT caused by my teeth but by the �strands� of slimey, writhing things that have �hooks� that pierce my upper palette, lips and tongue. These �strands� come up my throat into my mouth and nose. 

I have been to many infectious disease doctors and dentists who diagnosed everything from �in my head� to dry mouth (Sjorgren�s syndrome).  These conditions, along with neuralgia, were subsequently ruled out and I told the by the doctors that they did not know the cause of my complaints.  The only treatment that �worked� was when I treated for the giardia lamblia parasite.  The anti-parasitic medicine for that did start to affect this parasite. But it was not the correct medication. 

I fear that this situation is out of control and I am desperate for a physician/medical center who is an expert in parasitic infections, diagnosing and treating them.  A research scientist is not the answer � I need a doctor who actively does more lab testing than fecal samples and can treat this problem."

I'm going to the doctor again on Tuesday to see what we can do because now my lips are extremely dried out and feel like they're burning. I have no food allergies that I know of. I have had allergic reactions before to things like Nair, make-up, and detergent, but that's it. I've also gotten sensitive to smoke within the past year. It flares it up right away now.

Typcial symptoms include: runny, watery eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, post-nasal drip, swollen glands, pressure in face, sometimes head pain, sometimes neck pain, fatigue/sleepiness, 

What other allergy medicines are out there that will work good"

I actually got pregnant again in late 2004. I was getting the shot again after my second baby was born. Now I have stopped since my husband got a vasectomy. I noticed while on the shot I gained weight. Also my periods were all wacky. I could go 2 months or the whole 3 months without a period. I also had very bad mood swings. I also had absolutly no energy and was tired all the time. I am only 24 years old. After getting off the shot the first time I started to lose some of the weight and my periods returned to normal. Someone in another post mentioned that depo depleets the calcium in your body. I fractured my ankle when I stepped down wrong when I was 8 months pregnant with my 2nd child. Normally the way I twisted my ankle would have caused maybe a sprain. But I cracked the bone. Now I am wondering if the depo provera caused my bones to be more brittle.

I had a baby girl who is 4 now and everything was fine then had a miscarriage a year and a half later at 12 weeks they said it was some sort of chemical imbalance or something in the babys ganetic makeup and I am pregnant now almost 10 weeks.  This time last pregnancy I was spotting a tiny bit and I am not so I was wondering if it could happen again when I can carry healthy children.  It did take me almost 3 years to conceive this child though I dont know if that has anything to do with the miscarriage...thank you for reading.

I have muscle weakness, pain in most all of my joints& depression ever since I was misdianosed with lupus. I started out with 17 mg of prednisone & went all the way up to 500mg over a period of 6 months. 
The doctors were trying to convince my husband to institutionalize me cause they said the lupus had probably entered my brain & there was no coming back for me . My husband told the doctor's he wouldn't consider that cause he felt the reason I was hallucinating was caused by the bad reactions I was having to the 15 medications they were prescribing me. He insisted on further tests.
 I had to go through a MRI, brain scans, spinal tap & numerous other tests, all of which came back negative.  The final dianosis has been Fibromalgia. That was a year ago & I have been off of all medication since. I just hope there is some way to reverse the damage that I feel was caused by all the poisons prescribed to me."

I actually got pregnant again in late 2004. I was getting the shot again after my second baby was born. Now I have stopped since my husband got a vasectomy.

I also had absolutly no energy and was tired all the time. I am only 24 years old. After getting off the shot the first time I started to lose some of the weight and my periods returned to normal. Someone in another post mentioned that depo depleets the calcium in your body. I fractured my ankle when I stepped down wrong when I was 8 months pregnant with my 2nd child. Normally the way I twisted my ankle would have caused maybe a sprain. But I cracked the bone. Now I am wondering if the depo provera caused my bones to be more brittle.

I have been pregnant before, but all 3 of my pregnancies were not like this one... In fact I didn't get sick with my other pregnancies, nor did I have these symptoms. Should I be worried? Am I still pregnant or did I have a miscarriage?"

She does not see the destruction and harm she is doing.  She really thinks everything is okay.  I've always thought it was ""normal"" for her.   All the experts - therapists, lawyers, priests - have all told us - especially her - that she has no grounds for a divorce and she is acting irrational.  Living in CA, a no-fault divorce state, nothing can stop her from disolving the marriage.  However, a mental disorder can stop her from getting any form of visitation or custody of the kids.

Exubera, inhalable insulin developed by Pfizer, was approved for use in 1-2006. In 4-2006, the UK's NIH advised against the use of inhalable insulin on the grounds that avoiding injections did not justify the higher cost of the new product, estimated at �1100 per year. The NIH recommended in 6-2006 that diabetics should use Exubera only if they could establish 1) a medically proven fear of insulin injections or 2) chronic problems with their insulin injection sites.

Novo Nordisk, filed a lawsuit against Pfizer on 8-2006, claiming patent infringement, seeking both compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Novo sought an injunction preventing the release of Pfizer's 9-2006 launch of Exubera. A federal judge delayed a decision on Novo Nordisk's request for injunctive relief until 12-2006 court hearing. Pfizer's answer contends Novo wants to deny diabetics access to Exubera because it's the only FDA approved inhalable insulin & would hurt Novo Nordisk's business."

All these are the symptom of autism and we have the treatment for all these problem. You have to spend enough time for the intensive treatment in order to get good result, it varies from 1 month to 6 months or more for intensive treatment (remedies, remedy).
Some of the Autistic kids that is difficult to get near to 100 % cure is that they started late on themselves more then 11 years old for some, and others are too stubborn, but we still gets major improvement about 80-90% or so until they can get easy living in their life.

But because of this, mucus was going into my throat clogging it up and making me feel like I was going to faint and pass out. This usually happens a lot during the afternoon at work. This was before the medication and it continues after the medication. Doctor said it was an asthmatic reaction but it doesn't seem like asthma as I can breathe find.

My legs are absolutely killing me. They ache and cramp.

Those people need to get more educated about auto-immune diseases. When someone has a thryoid problem such as hypothyroidism (and no, this doesn't happen to ALL of them, but most) is that their metabolism slows or even shuts down almost completely depending on how severe their problem is. No, pills don't aways ""cure"" people and then they drop weight. The more calories resricted for someone with hypothyroidism, the MORE wt. they gain. This has been found over and over again.

My mother was diagnosed with Bi-polar back in 1993 and has had to be court ordered to take medications following three very sever manic episodes.  This past year was the last, and she was in the hospital for several months.  She has her medications stable again, Lithium, and a couple new ones. This time around she and my dad ended up divorcing as a result, and I have helped her restart a new life on her own.  She is very depressed and I know that doctors don't necessarily recommend anti-depresents with bi-polar disorder.  Is there something to help her from being so depressed?  She has a fear of doctors as well, which doesn't help.  I try to see her as often as I can, but it is very hard to see her so despondent.  She won't take care of herself or her new place.  We have found a program to help with a nurse three times a day and house cleaning.  But it seems as soon as I go away she will resort back to watching tv/sleeping and crying all the time.

My question was more of a comment on political correctness. Both are rude, and we live in a country were you can say and do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't impede on the rights of others. If you want to smoke, you should be able to smoke, if you want to eat yourself to death, you have that right too. But lets not pretend that one is better then the other. Really, do you think that the number of people who suffer from these ""conditions"" that cause obesety is all that significant? Instead of making excuses, more people should own up to there faults. I am overweight, I admit it. And, I used to smoke. I am not blaming anyone. It's funny, though. When I told people that I quit smoking, they congratulated me. When I started my diet, They all told me that I wasn't overweight, or not to ""take it too far"". I am 5'8, 195lbs. Anorexia isn't even an issue. No one even thought of the health risks that attributed my being overweight, but everyone thought of the potential of me starving myself to death.

Just a question. I am a 27-year-old woman and I am wondering if this is normal. Whenever I go to bed or say I am napping whether its a 1 hour nap or I am getting up from a nights sleep I have to hobble out of bed until I get moving more--this has been going on for the last couple of months it almost feels kind of like tendonitis in the ankles, however my calves are so tight when I first get up that they hurt to move as well...I mean I am not 18 but I am not old either is this normal you think or is it just from being stiff from sleeping through the night? cause once i get moving around I can walk just fine and stuff.

I preferred to not give her anymore of the offending formula and instead fed her plain water.  She never gets more than 2 ounces at a time because I do fear for hyponatremia.

I've had my thyroid function tested 2 - 4 times in the past decade, and it always comes back normal. Usually it leans slightly toward the ""fast"" end of normal, but definitely NOT in the range of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). 

I've also had bloodwork to see if I have malabsorption of certain nutrients, which could explain my difficulty in gaining weight and might indicate an intestinal or metabolic disorder. Those tests came back normal also.

So basically I have a fast metabolism and need to live with it. However, now that I got a new job that's more active, and now that I'm on Wellbutrin for my ADHD & anxiety, I'm actually losing weight -- and I don't want to! :( Being underweight has its own set of health risks; it's not just overweight that's bad!

this is whats listed for vitex? 
Vitex does not contain natural hormones. It appears to increase progesterone by stimulating luteinizing hormone release from the pituitary gland. Vitex also normalizes excessive prolactin, promoting fertility. 
Female infertility

PMS, especially breast tenderness, cramping, and headaches

Acne, especially if it is related to the menstrual cycle

Fibrocystic breast disease

Heavy menstruation

Now, medicine has evolved to where we are keeping people with serious diseases such as depression, diabetes, asthma, etc alive with drugs.

This hits on a personal note because I have serious asthma and probably would have died before the age of 5 if there wasn't today's medicine.

The anti-flipflop articles say that b/c flip flops lack arch support your feet may get fallen arches. However many websites that encourage bare feet (which I also do a lot but only indoors) say that going barefoot can HELP strengthen your feet and develop good arches.

See the contradiction? Going barefoot and flip flops both have no arch support but barefoot can ""tone your feet"" and flip flops will ""cause fallen arches"". It makes no sense. I think flip flops is the closest you can get to natural barefoot walking without dirty feet and risk injury/infection. Can someone explain? Thanks!

Chemical methods of birth control are also linked to cancer
The ones that cause abortions are; Copper T IUD, Progestasert IUD, The Mini-Pill, The Morning After Pill, and of course RU-486, taken after implantation.

The ones that MAY cause abortions are; The Pill, Implants, Shots, Patches, and Vaginal Ring.

There are many methods of birth control that do not cause abortions (or cancer). They are called ""barrier methods"" and they include; abstinence, periodic abstinence (a.k.a. Rhythm Method), condom (male and female versions), diaphragm, cervical cap, Spermicides, and/or surgical sterilization. It is recommended that at least two of these be used at once, as they are still not foolproof. If one fails, the other one can help to cover the ""gaps"".

If you are firmly pro-life, do you believe that the abortifacient methods of birth control are wrong?

I'm 34, my oldest child is 15 months, and I'm suffering a bit with a flabby tummy after 2 kids in 3 years :)

I eat pretty healthily - when I tried to count calories, I'm not exceeding 1500 cals/day. I eat vegetables with meals, don't snack, do have a sweet tooth, but don't indulge it that often!

I am however 13 stone or so, and only 5'0. This puts me in the clinically obese category. 

I was born with club foot (both feet). Have had 8 operations on one ankle and 3 on the other.

Swimming would be great, but with 2 kids and a husband who works odd shifts, it's not possible to get to a pool.

All these are the symptom of autism and we have the treatment for all these problem. You have to spend enough time for the intensive treatment in order to get good result, it varies from 1 month to 6 months or more for intensive treatment (remedies, remedy).
Some of the Autistic kids that is difficult to get near to 100 % cure is that they started late on themselves more then 11 years old for some, and others are too stubborn, but we still gets major improvement about 80-90% or so until they can get easy living in their life.

I read something about depersonalization being connected with epilepsy, which I have, and had a seizure when I was 8.

I read you feel disconnected from the world, but I don't know if that's how i feel but I do feel very unimportant to other people. I might just be used to the feeling of being detached from myself cuz I might have had it for a while.

The anti-flipflop articles say that b/c flip flops lack arch support your feet may get fallen arches. However many websites that encourage bare feet (which I also do a lot but only indoors) say that going barefoot can HELP strengthen your feet and develop good arches.

See the contradiction? Going barefoot and flip flops both have no arch support but barefoot can ""tone your feet"" and flip flops will ""cause fallen arches"". It makes no sense.

I am my mother's carer as for years since i could remember my mum has been sick with CFS?
Six mths ago I noticed a change in my mum with speech,memory problems and sleeping as well as having no energy.
My mum then fell over for no reason that I saw and had a stay in hospital for a week with fitting and other injuries.
Since all that my mum has had consitent headaches as well as ongoing pain which leaves her breathless and so moody and tired?
then I notice her hair thining and mum's hair all over the place.
At last I got her to the doctors and they stunnned us both when they told mum and I she had cancer that matches her CFS  sypmtons which were  similar?
They done all the tests and mum's treatment will bide time but only to make her comfy so now  mum has refused treatments then gets told she has 5 years to live as long as she gets no infections,then it could be 6mths?
How do i watch my mum die?

We got her to take her medicine again, but as soon as she felt better she quit taking it.  Now she is acting nuts again, but instead of being happy and manic, she is extremely anxious.  She worries about completely irrational things, she says she doesn't have any money (she has a ton of money in the bank) and can't afford groceries, she thinks people are planning to rob her or attack her, etc....We got her to go to her psychiatrist, and he prescribed Zyprexa, Zanax (sp?), and Depakote, but they don't seem to be working.

I started Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo in March of this year. I have gained, at most, about four pounds while on the pill, but considering I moved to college and my lifestyle habits have changed a lot, I cannot blame the gain entirely on the pill. 
I do know, however, that before I was on the pill, I could lose weight and keep it off incredibly easy. Now, I exercise three to five times a week, for about 45-60 minutes each time, doing both cardio and weights. I also try to watch what I eat (although I don't do as great a job at that). Despite working so much harder now, I have not lost any weight in three months of exercising. I have a feeling the inability to lose weight IS due to the pill.  
This really isn't a vanity issue; my entire family has weight, diabetes and heart problems, so it is very important to me to keep my weight down and under control.
Will getting off the pill for two months or so help me with this problem?"

Vitex does not contain natural hormones. It appears to increase progesterone by stimulating luteinizing hormone release from the pituitary gland. Vitex also normalizes excessive prolactin, promoting fertility.

Is that cruel? am not for sure it is each time he has the things that his stomach gets offset. Should I ask the doctor or wait until I know or sure since he is so young? Should i try giving him a glass of milk and seeing if he vomits? Is that cruel? Any suggestions or advice woul be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

She gets her medication from a free clinic, so we don't always have alot of pills for her.  It's just not all that reliable, unfortunately.  So she just takes 10 milligrams a day, in order to stretch them out.

I think she could really raise her success rate with these pills by upping the dose to 25 mg a day.  At least until we can afford to regularly purchase her medication at a pharmacy... 

So is 10mg even worth taking though?"

I am 32 yrs old...a coach, a teacher, a person who loves to work with kids...who got married 10 years ago to a woman who already had a son.  I found out a year into our marraige that I could not have my own child.  This, of course devastated me.  I have a good relationship wih my stepson, but it is not the same.  My wife refused to adopt.  I yearn for the father-child relationship that I have for whatever reason been deprived from having.  I have a rotten relationship with my wife.  Sex is non-existant...there is no intimacy.  Im losing my mind.  I want to leave and see if there is any hope of starting over but am afraid of the thought of dating and mentioning that I cannnot have kids.  What do I do?  Are there good girls still left for a 32 year old like me?  I just want to be #1 to somebody."

I am fed up with neck pain and vicious headaches at the back of my head. I also have prolapsed discs in the neck area and at the base of my spine. You can't describe the pain to anybody and since there is nothing to see people tend not to believe you. I have had MRI scans but since I have also had a minor heart attack the medicos seem reluctant to give me any treatment apart from pain killers. I can't even take anti-inflammatories. Anyone got any serious suggestions?

Two years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD due to severe childhood sexual and physical abuse, and borderline personality disorder.  I hadn't tried to get any help before then, and was involuntarily committed because my roommate caught me drawing pictures with my blood (note to self: keep doors locked).  The doctors gave me a bunch of drugs that made me fat (I gained fifty pounds), so i quit them, and went crazy again (I threw blood on someone, but they deserved it).  So I spent another couple of months in the hospital and stayed fat.  Now I'm out, again, and have been off medication for nine months and am losing weight.  Aside from that I hate myself and sometimes I burn myself and sometimes I have panic attacks if I'm in sexual situations I'm doing pretty well.  All the doctors (at least the ones I can afford) want to do is pump me with medications that make sleepy and stupid and lazy.  Is it really such a problem that I'm not in therapy if I'm only a danger to myself?"
